                <h1>What is the view on disabilities is Sweden?</h1>

                <p>
                    If you are planning to move to Sweden as a disabled person, you
                    might have some concerns regarding the view on disabilities in Sweden.
                    In order for you to feel safe and normal where you are, you have
                    to be treated fairly. But it is almost impossible to know such things
                    in advance. Therefore, you will get a hint of what it might be like
                    if you decide to move to Sweden.

                <h2>Swedes are tolerant</h2>

                <p>
                    The first thing you need to know about swedes, is that they are a
                    very tolerable people. They have a high acceptance for different
                    religions, different sexual orientations and also a very high acceptance
                    for differencies over all. The typical swede will not look twice at
                    someone in a wheelchair for example. However, there will always be
                    idiots everywhere you go so there are no garanties for not being
                    misstreated.

                <h2>Sweden has a lot of support to offer</h2>

                <p>
                    One reason why swedes may have such a high tolerance for disabled
                    people, might be because there is a lot of support in place for
                    people with disabilities. The general rule of thumb, is that a person
                    with disabilities should be able to live as normal as possible and
                    be as self sufficient as possible with a bit of help from the society.
