            <h1>What is the view on disabilities is Sweden?</h1>

            <p>
                If you are planning to move to Sweden as a disabled person, you
                might have some concerns regarding the view on disabilities in Sweden.
                In order for you to feel safe and normal where you are, you have
                to be treated fairly. But it is almost impossible to know such things
                in advance. Therefore, you will get a hint of what it might be like
                if you decide to move to Sweden.

        <div class="div2">
            <h2>Swedes are tolerant</h2>

            <p>
                The first thing you need to know about swedes, is that they are a
                very tolerable people. They have a high acceptance for different
                religions, different sexual orientations and also a very high acceptance
                for differencies over all. A normal swede will not look twice at
                someone in a wheelchair for example. However, there will always be
                idiots everywhere you go so there are no garanties for not being
                misstreated.

        <div class="div1">
            <h2>Sweden has a lot of support to offer</h2>

            <p>
                One reason why swedes may have such a high tolerance for disabled
                people, might be because there is a lot of support in place for
                people with disabilities. The general rule of thumb, is that a person
                with disabilities should be able to live as normal as possible and
                be as self sufficient as possible with a bit of help from the society.
