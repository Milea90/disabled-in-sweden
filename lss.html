                <h1>What is L.S.S?</h1>

                <p>
                    L.S.S stands for "lagen om st√∂d och service" and translates to "the
                    law of support and service". This law is made for people who have
                    special needs. The purpose of the law, is to make sure that the society
                    provides people with disabilities and special needs the right kind
                    of support they need in order to become and feel like normal people.
                    For example, according to L.S.S, a person with disabilities might have
                    access to support like:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-text">
                    <li>Personal assistance with things that has to do with everyday life</li>
                    <li>A place to live, with integrated support for people with special
                        needs.</li>
                    <li>Escort services outside the own home.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The list with different kind of support according to L.S.S is long. What
                    all of them have in common, is to make life easier and, if possible,
                    more fun for someone with disabilities. The goal is also to make them
                    as self sufficient as possiple.

                <h2>How to get help according to L.S.S</h2>

                <p>
                    In order to get help according to L.S.S, you have to live in Sweden.
                    You then have to send a written application to the swedish county
                    where you are a resident. You should be able to confirm your needs
                    together with the application. It can for example be a doctors opinion.
                    A case manager will then make an assessment of your application.
                    It is the county where you live that is responsible for providing
                    you with information about LSS.

                    It is important to note that not all disabled people can recieve
                    help according to L.S.S. The complete description of the law is "the
