            <h1>What is LSS?</h1>

            <p>
                LSS stands for "lagen om st√∂d och service" and it translates to "the
                law of support and service". This law is made for people who have
                special needs. The purpose of the law, is to make sure that the society
                provide people with disabilities and special needs with the right kind
                of support they need in order to become and feel like normal people.
                For example, according to LSS, a person with disabilties might have
                access to support like:
            <ul>
                <li>Personal assistance with things that has to do with everyday life</li>
                <li>A place to live with integrated support for people with special
                    needs.</li>
                <li>Escort services outside the own home.</li>
            </ul>
            The list with different kind of support according to LSS is long. What
            all of them have in common, is to make life easier and, if possible,
            more fun for someone with disabilities. The goal is also to make them
            as selfsufficient as possiple.

            <h2>How to get help according to LSS</h2>

            <p>
                In order to get help according to LSS, you have to live in Sweden.
                You then have to send a written application to the swedish county
                where you are a resident. You should be able to confirm your needs
                together with the application. It can for example be a doctors opinion.
                A case manager will then make an assessment of your application.
                It is the county where you live that is responsible for providing
                you with information about LSS.
            </p>

            <h2>An important note to make</h2>

            <p>
                It is important to note that not all disabled people can recieve
                help according to LSS. The complete description of the law is "the
                law of support and service for <strong>some</strong> disabled people."
                The case manager will assess if you are one of those who can recieve
                help and support according to LSS.
