# Disabled in Sweden

Link to the page:


## Background 
The background story of the website is actually that I had a dream about making this website. So I did/will do.

## Purpose  
The main purpose of this website is to help people, especially those with disabilities, to access information about the Swedish support systems for disabled in an easy way. It can bedifficult for an outsider to know where to find the information and to understand it. Therefore the content will give some basic information on the topic. There will also be links to where one can find out more.


## Implemenation

To create a website for mainly disabled, the website will be highly focused on accessability. Therefore, I will strive to:

* structure the layout of the website so that it will be easy to understand and to navigate. No unnecessary content or layout that can distract the user.
* choose colors for the site according to colorblindness, for example blue with yellow, wich also matches the theme of the website since the swedish flag is blue and yellow.
* implement code that makes it easy for screenreaders to read the content on the website in a correct maner, for example, by using aria-labels and/or semantic code, by writing good alt-names for images, choosing an accessable font-style etc etc.
* write the content with the purpose of making it simple and easy to understand, for example, keep the content short and percise. 
* make it easy for the user to navigate to an external websites to learn more about the subject if they want to.
* use a consistent design on all 6 pages.
* validate the code with WC3 to be sure the code passes the accessibility test 
* use google translate to make sure that english screan readers works properly since my native language is not english

## Languages used
HTML5, CSS


## Technologies used
Git, Github, Code Anywhere, Bootstrap? 
I also tried to install a Chrome screanreader on my computer but I could not figure out how it worked. So unfortunatly, I do not know how well my implemantations work with screanreaders.

## Images
The images is downloaded from: 

## Written content
The content is written by myself. The content has also been going through a plagiarism checker to make sure none of the content was plagiarized. 
The soucres for the content comes from swedish websites such as: 
www.do.se
www.fk.se
www.kunskapsguiden.se

I use many shortenings for different swedish institutions and suchs on the website. Therefore I have tried to have accessibility in mind by using a dot between them so a screan reader would read for example DO as D.O and not "do".

## Colors
In order to set the colors for the website, I used this website: https://www.colorblindguide.com/post/colorblind-friendly-design-3 to help me choose colors that worked well with colorblind, like yellow and blue.


## UX-design
I imagine that the main user will be, but does not have to be, someone with disabilities. Therefore I will create a website that takes that into account thruout the complete website, on every page, from top to bottom. That will include things like: 

* using aria lables
* choosing colors according to colorblindness
* easy navigation
* writing content that is easy to understand
* chosing fonts that are easy to read
* implementing icon fonts to make the site a bit "ligther" in a sense.  

## Used code
In order to be able to finish the procect in time, I have used this website a lot:
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp
It helped me to find quick answers to how to write my code in order to get the result I was looking for. It is a great website when I need a syntax for whatever reason. 
I have written tons of notes during the HTML/CSS course, but due to the limited timeframe for finishing the project, I quickly found out that Google gave me much quicker and better answers than trying to find the answers among hundreds of different notes. At times, I do not even understand my own notes due to the lack of fine handwriting and total lack of structure.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge everyone on slack for helping out with miner issues. And also...
