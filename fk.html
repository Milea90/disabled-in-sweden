        <h1>What is FK?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>FK, is shorthand for Försäkringskassan. That is an insitution in Sweden which is part of the social support system.
            FK is where you go when you need financial help when you can not support yourself. Maybe you have been in 
            an accident and are unable to work. Maybe you have got a bad disease that prevents you from working. The reasons for
            why one can not support themselfs can be many, but FK is supposed to help you financially when you are in need for it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>How to get help from FK</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            In order to get help from FK, you first need to see a doctor. He or she will determine your condition and give you a 
            written certificate where his or shes opinions are stated. If the doctors opinion is that you are unable to work, then
            FK should atend to thät. That is why you need the written certificate from the doctor in order to get help from FK.
        </p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <h2>FK is not a popular institution</h2>   
         <br>
         <p>
            It is worth mentioning that FK may have their own opinion about your physical and/or mental condition. That means, that
            even if you have a statement from the doctor which clearly indicates that you are unable to work, FK can still deny you help.
            That is also the main reason why FK is a very impopular institution.
         <br>
            Another thing that is important to note, is that you have to live in Sweden in order to get help from FK.      
        </p>

        <br>
