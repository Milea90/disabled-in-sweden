            <h1>What is D.O</h1>

            <p>
                D.O is shorthand for "Diskrimineringsombudsmannen" which is an
                administrative authority in Sweden. It handles legal cases where
                people have been discriminated by the society. In Sweden, it is
                illigal to discriminate and treat people with disabilities different
                from other people. Therefore, D.O is there to persue legal cases
                on the behalf of those disabled people who might have been discriminated.

                <strong>
                    Important to note, is that D.O does not persue legal
                    cases between private individuals. They only handle cases where
                    corporations, institutions and such are involed.

            <h2>How to get help from D.O</h2>

            <p>
                In order to persue a legal case with help from D.O, you have to
                write to D.O and describe in detail what has happened. Describe when
                it happened, where it happened and who was involved. D.O will then
                assess your information and decide wether or not they will persue
                a legal case based on your information.
                <br>
