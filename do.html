                <p>
                    D.O is shorthand for "Diskrimineringsombudsmannen" which is an
                    administrative authority in Sweden. It handles legal cases where
                    people have been discriminated by the society. In Sweden, it is
                    illigal to discriminate and treat people with disabilities different
                    from other people. Therefore, D.O is there to persue legal cases
                    on the behalf of those disabled people who might have been discriminated.

                    <strong>
                        Important to note, is that D.O does not persue legal
                        cases between private individuals. They only handle cases where
                        corporations, institutions and such are involed.

                <h2>How to get help from D.O</h2>

                <p>
                    In order to persue a legal case with help from D.O, you have to
                    write to D.O and describe in detail what has happened. Describe when
                    it happened, where it happened and who was involved. D.O will then
                    assess your information and decide wether or not they will persue
                    a legal case based on your information.
