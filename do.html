                <p id="do-text">
                    D.O is shorthand for "Diskrimineringsombudsmannen" which is an
                    administrative authority in Sweden. It handles legal cases if
                    someone has been discriminated by the society. In Sweden, it is
                    illegal to discriminate and treat people with disabilities different
                    from other people. Therefore, D.O is there to pursue legal cases
                    on the behalf of those disabled who might have been discriminated.

                    <strong>
                        Important to note, is that D.O does not pursue legal
                        cases between private individuals. They only handle cases where
                        corporations, institutions and such are involved.

                <h2>How to get help from D.O</h2>

                <p>
                    In order to pursue a legal case with help from D.O, you have to
                    write to D.O and describe in detail what has happened. Describe when
                    it happened, where it happened and who was involved. D.O will then
                    assess your information and decide whether or not they will pursue
                    a legal case based on your information.
